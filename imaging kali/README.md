# PIMP MY KALI

This repo has you covered. Now, do you need everything in this repo? Probably not, but a quick Impacket-based reinstall script makes all the difference. 
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
```
sudo shutdown -r now
```
```
git clone https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali
cd pimpmykali
chmod +x ./pimpmykali
sudo ./pimpmykali
```
If you have a fresh image, use option zero. Not really needed for the oscp but handy. 

## Setting up Burp Suite
